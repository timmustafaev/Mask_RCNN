# Mask_RCNN
Mask R-CNN for object detection and instance segmentation on Keras and TensorFlow

This implementation of Mask R-CNN was used develop my bachelor's degree project. Its main objective consisted in training the ConvNet to detect multiple potato crops in a single image simultaneously predicting their growth stage.

The main script that was used for the training is contained in the "mainscript" file and more information on the project can be found in the "thesis" file.
